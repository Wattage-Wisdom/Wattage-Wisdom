- ðŸ‘‹ Hey everyone, my name's Caleb and I'm an electrical engineer by trade and hobby!
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m mainly interested in machine learning and control algorithms but I'm always willing to learn and explore other areas
- ðŸŒ± For my current tinker project I'm attempting to build my own Gauss Rifle
- ðŸ“« Follow me at my YouTube Channel @Wattage_Wisdom, I try and post explanational videos about complex electrical engineering topics
    -This is my way of giving thanks for all those who came before me and created the videos that I have learned so much from
