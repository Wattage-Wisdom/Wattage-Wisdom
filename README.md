Hey everyone, my name's Caleb and I'm an electrical engineer by trade and hobby.
I am a firm believer that anyone with the willpower (and internet access) can become an expert in any field they desire. 
So, with virtually all of humanities knowledge at our fingertips, it's time to get out there and start learning!
I hope we can assist one another along our journey into the exciting world of electrical engineering.
